Hi Dat

In today's post, we will learn how to make our OpenCV code 5x faster with just one line of code change. 

OpenCV Transparent API (C++/Python)

The Transparent API (T-API) in OpenCV has been around since version 3.0 but Python support was added only in version 3.2. T-API uses OpenCL under the hood and technically it can use your GPU, multiple processors or even DSPs ( although I have never tested this ). You don't have to manually write code for checking what computing resources are available on a machine. T-API does this seamlessly for you. 

There is one caveat though. There is an overhead for sending image data to the GPU and it does not make sense to incur this overhead when the computation is not expensive. So, use it wisely or else it will backfire!

Hope this email was helpful. Happy hacking!
